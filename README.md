## Info

A reddit-like news aggregator.

Designed to be served directly from couchdb to allow for easy scalability.

Currently uses the same ranking algorithm for both posts and comments and is similar to reddit's hot ranking. I plan on implementing similar to reddit's best algorithm for comments.

## Deploying this app

Assuming you just cloned this app from git, and you have changed into the app directory in your terminal, you want to push it to your CouchDB with the CouchApp command line tool, like this:

    couchapp push http://name:password@hostname:5984/mydatabase
